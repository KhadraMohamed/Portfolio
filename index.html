    <p>I am Khadra Mohamed</p>
    <p>I've been intrested in coding like many others for a while now, and during the last few months of my internship I dabbled in some free online bootcamps and really enjoyed them. And so when I finished my internship I applied to Manchester Codes. So far really enjoying it.</p>
